# Reinforcement learning in Julia

Purpose of this project/ repository is to replicate Practical RL course (https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL) exercises in Julia.

About Practical RL (from their GitHub): A course on reinforcement learning in the wild. Taught on-campus in HSE and Yandex SDA.

## Setup

This code was tested on Julia 0.6.1.

Please follow standard process to configure `Open AI` and `POMDPs.jl` from the corresponding package repository.

## Table of contents

The following objectives are implemented and available as a separate Julia files:

week_0: FrozenLake with genetic algorithms
- FrozenLake (4x4): average score 0.86
- FrozenLake (8x8): average score 0.97

week_1: Behind the schedule
- I was busy rewriting the code to work with POMDPs package

## T&C

I will try to follow Julia best practices when writing code and optimize it whenever and wherever possible.

Please excuse in case of any serious issues and you are welcome to submit your PR.
